Bugs:

#1 In CommandsFactory CreateUserCommand is missing
#2 Method for logging error in FileLogger is commented out.
#3 In ModelsFactory CreateUser email and username are swapped.
#4 Some Command classes had their own instances of the databse and therefore were not sharing the data betweeen eachother. Fixed by moving dtabase as an external dependency.

Bottleneck: In the class CommandsFactory, the method BuildCommand always waits for 1 second before doing anything. Fixed by removing the unnecessary while loop.
